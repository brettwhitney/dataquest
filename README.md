# Dataquest Projects
This is where I host my projects and other code generated as I work through dataquest's R and Python courses.

## Forest Fires
In this small project I got a lot of great practice writing functions for plotting with `ggplot2` and then applying those functions with `purrr::map()` and `purrr::map2()`. The data is available for download [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/). For more information about some of the variables in this dataset, visit [this website](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi).
